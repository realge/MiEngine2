## PROJECTS

### **Advanced Vulkan 3D Graphics Engine** | C++
*Personal Project | 2024*

- Engineered a production-grade **3D rendering engine** from scratch using **Vulkan API** and modern C++17, demonstrating mastery of low-level graphics programming
- Implemented **Physically-Based Rendering (PBR)** pipeline with **Image-Based Lighting (IBL)** including dynamic environment maps, irradiance mapping, and specular reflections for photorealistic rendering
- Developed comprehensive **shadow mapping system** with real-time directional and point light shadows, including PCF filtering and optimized shadow frustum culling
- Architected efficient **GPU memory management** system with custom allocators, descriptor set pooling, and multi-threaded command buffer recording for optimal performance
- Built modular **material system** supporting texture mapping (albedo, normal, metallic-roughness, emissive) and runtime shader hot-reloading for rapid iteration
- Created multiple game modes including **voxel-based Minecraft clone** with procedural terrain generation using Perlin noise and chunk-based rendering
- Designed debug visualization tools with **ImGui integration** for real-time performance profiling and shader debugging (15 debug layers for shadow, lighting, and material analysis)
- Achieved **60+ FPS** at 1080p rendering complex scenes with hundreds of objects, dynamic lighting, and post-processing effects

**Technical Highlights:**
- Custom render pass management with deferred rendering support
- Skybox rendering with HDR environment maps and automatic mipmap generation  
- Efficient mesh loading pipeline supporting OBJ/glTF formats with vertex deduplication
- Advanced shader system with SPIR-V compilation and pipeline state caching
- Multi-frame synchronization using semaphores and fences for tear-free rendering
